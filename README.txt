Project: Streamlit Camera Input Image Saver
===========================================

Overview
--------
This project demonstrates how to capture an image using Streamlit's 
camera_input widget and save it to a local file. The application mimics 
the behavior of traditional OpenCV image capture (e.g., using cap.read())
but is designed for web applications using Streamlit.

Features
--------
- Capture an image directly from your device's camera.
- Save the captured image as a file to a specified directory.
- Display confirmation messages upon successful image saving.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit

Installation
------------
1. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
2. Install Streamlit using pip:
   
   pip install streamlit

Usage
-----
1. Place the project files in a directory.
2. Run the application with Streamlit from your terminal:

   streamlit run your_app.py

3. A browser window will open displaying the application.
4. Click the "Capture an Image" button to use your device's camera.
5. Once an image is captured, the app will save the image to the path 
   specified in the code (e.g., "path/to/save/image.jpg") and show a 
   success message.

Code Snippet Example
--------------------
Below is a snippet from the main application:

    import streamlit as st

    # Capture image using Streamlit camera input widget
    uploaded_file = st.camera_input("Capture an Image")

    if uploaded_file is not None:
        # Save the image file to disk
        with open("saved_image.jpg", "wb") as f:
            f.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
        st.success("Image saved successfully!")

Notes
-----
- Adjust the file path ("saved_image.jpg" or a full path) as needed.
- Ensure your browser has permission to access the camera.
- This app is intended for demonstration purposes and can be extended 
  to include image processing, integration with AI APIs, etc.
